    <h3>Who I am: </h3>
    <p> Allow me to introduce myself; My name is Jesse Baker. This is a blog dedicated to my journey becomming a developer consisting of how I started, whatI am learning, and what I aim to achieve. I am hoping this document will serveas a future reference to my former timid self, and a reminder that setting time aside for personal growth introduces new and exciting opportunites.</p>

    <h3>How I Started</h3>
    <p>Like many, I became interested in computers at a young age. Initially I was always outside with friends, but as I grew so did the level of punishment for my acting out. Eventually I was in a perpetual state of 'all work and no play', trapped in a house alone with a computer. We had these things called Macs at school, but they just looked like mini televisions if you ask me.

    <p>I remember playing with the paint program a few times, especially the turtle stamps; we would paste them all over the place, resizing, copying, coloring. It was mindless entertainment but it taught me a lot about how to manuever with a mouse and a keyboard. I was 5 or 6 then, and I was around 7 or 8 when I started messing with my home computer. This was not a Mac. However, it was an autocad machine. My mom was a architectural student at the time and she was always on this thing when she wasn't physcially in class or at work (usually she was using this computer on the weekends or after 7-8p.m. during the week). For about 3 hours a day after school, since I was not to leave the house, I would sit on the computer. Granted I did not know excatly how things worked, nor did I have anyone to teach me, but I have always had a tendency to learn by exlporing and experimenting. Not to brag, but as a result of all of this time behind a keyboard I became quite proficient with search engines. It taught me how to access music for free ( sorry copyright laws ) and, in a pathetic attempt, to download and play pc games. Had I not crashed my mothers computer 5 or 6 times, I would probably never have learned these valuable lessons

    2. don't crash your moms school computer becuase her midterms are more important than pirating warcraft.</p>

    <h3>Progress and Current Status</h3>
    <p>It has been a few years since crashing my moms ( or any ) computers. I have taken courses on Unix, machine/assembly language, and gone through comptia books ( A+, Network+, and Security+ ). Learning this sort of information took quite a bit of time and practice ( not to mention failure; I just lost a completed version of this webpage because I accidentally did a cp to the wrong directory. I guess I should make more commits more frequently ).

    <p>Now, I have a job dealing with Networks and Servers for a small consulting firm. It is fun, and I enjoy what I do to some degree. However, my boss has recently asked me how what it is that I enjoy doing most. I replied "I suppose that I enjoy doing things that involve bash or programming more than anything-". As a result, my boss and one of our senior developers have started assigning me to projects that involve writing bash scripts or teaching me ASP/.net so that I can help more with web and application development. Couple that with launchcode and I am almost where I wish to be.

    <h3>What I Wish To Achieve</h3>
    <p>To conclude, I wish to discuss the reason behind this Journey. The reason I have been so persistent in learning this material, specifically how programming, is so that I can apply for positions as a jr. developer. I wish to truly dive into coding exclusivly even though I am not sure which track I would like to hone in on. I am hoping that following the web development and the Java unit that I will have an idea of which path I would like to place an emphasis. For now I am thankful to have mentors around me who are willing to push me in the right direction and feed my love of learning. Without that assistance I am not sure that I would even be considering a field in anything related to electronics. I hope this serves as a reminder in the future as to why I chose to embark on this endeavour.</p>
